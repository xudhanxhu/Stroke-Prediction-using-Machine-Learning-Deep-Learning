# 🚀 Stroke Prediction Model - Machine Learning & Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project builds a **stroke prediction model** using multiple machine learning and deep learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, model calibration, and explainability techniques.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)
- Features: 22 columns, including patient demographics and health records.
- Objective: Predict the likelihood of a **stroke (binary classification problem)**.

## 🏗️ Key Features
✅ **Feature Engineering & Preprocessing**: One-hot encoding, missing value imputation, outlier handling, and feature selection.  
✅ **Data Balancing**: SMOTE, Random Undersampling, and SMOTETomek to handle class imbalance.  
✅ **Models Implemented**:  
   - **Neural Network** (TensorFlow/Keras)  
   - **XGBoost**  
   - **Random Forest**  
   - **Logistic Regression**  
✅ **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using **Optuna** for optimizing model parameters.  
✅ **Model Calibration**: **Isotonic Regression** for improving probability estimates.  
✅ **Explainability**: **SHAP** (Shapley Additive Explanations) for feature importance analysis.  
✅ **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, Brier Score.

| Random Forest      | 0.974585 | 0.990354   | 0.958506 | 0.974170 | 0.993180 | 0.990124 |
| Logistic Regression| 0.808091 | 0.781784   | 0.854772 | 0.816650 | 0.873493 | 0.836539 |
| Neural Network (NN) | 0.950207 | 0.934870   | 0.967842 | 0.951070 | 0.981484 | 0.974995 |

## 📢 Results & Insights
- The **Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy (97.46%)**, while **XGBoost performed best in overall AUC (99.52%)**.
- **Feature importance analysis** showed `age`, `avg_glucose_level`, and `hypertension` as strong predictors.
- **Model calibration improved probability predictions**, reducing **Brier Score** and **Expected Calibration Error (ECE)**.
- **SHAP analysis** provided insights into how features affect stroke predictions.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Implement **more advanced deep learning architectures**.
- Experiment with **additional feature engineering techniques**.
- Deploy the model as a **web API using FastAPI or Flask**.
- Develop an interactive **dashboard using Streamlit**.
